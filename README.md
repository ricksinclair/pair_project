# 90 Minute Pair Project -- Shipping Service


This project was a quick 90-minute exercise using spring boot to create a two-microservice application. One service would interact directly with the myql database and another would be an edge service that user clients directly interacted with. More testing should be implemented in the future including true end-to-end testing instead of unit testing/ service layer mocks.
